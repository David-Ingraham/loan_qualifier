# Loan Qualifying App

Just after the title, introduce your project by describing attractively what the project is about and what is the main problem that inspires you to create this project or what is the main contribution for the potential user of your project.

Looking to find my own lenders, I compiled a csv file of possible loan options in the markets. This project automates a debtor's search for a loan they qaulify for, and uses industry standards like income and laon-to-value ratio to do so.

## Technologies

Describe the technologies required to use your project such as programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and operating systems. Be sure to include the specific versions of any critical dependencies that you have used in the stable version of your project.

Written in python 3.7, this app levredges modules from the libraries sys, fire, path and questionairy to acheive its desired goals. sys fucntions as an event manager, it exits the app when necessary and directs the work flow to other modules when necessary conditions are met by the user. fire generates the command line interface, while the path library interprets file locations for theprogram to pull data from. Finally, the questionairy library allows for dynamic coding of users input variables, and lets this app get specified data from the users. In the future, the Plaid API could be added to this proect to add verification fucnitonality for the users fincancil information.
